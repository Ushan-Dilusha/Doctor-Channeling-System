Web Application Development final assignment

Our website
------------------------------------------------
Through our website, patients search for any doctor by name, specialization, or hospital. The website will retrieve a list of doctors relevant to the search query from our database. 
This list will be sorted in order of proximity to the user and will display most essential information of the doctors including their name, profile picture and professional details.
A user can select a doctor of their preference from the list. The user will then be directed to a webpage with a map showing all locations where the doctor works. This is a doctor’s work portfolio.
This map can also be used to obtain directions to these locations from the user’s current location. 
Below the map will be a table which contains the working days and working hours for each location of the selected doctor. The page will also contain additional information about the doctor.  
Both patients and doctors will have to register into our website to use it. We will develop two separate webpages for registration of doctors and patients.
Patients will only have to provide their address of residence in addition to their age and email address. Doctors will have to provide all their work addresses, working days, work hours and professional information as well. 
All information provided by patients and doctors will be saved into a database.
We will also provide customer support via e-mail. Customers can go to our Contact Us page and send us e-mails requesting any support regarding the website which we will be much obliged to provide.
Even though our solution is very simple, there are no other websites that provide this service. Because our idea is simple yet new, this puts us at a unique advantage.
Most other similar websites provide e-channeling facilities. But e-channeling is less practical and limited to hospitals and clinics that provide support for e-channeling.
Our service is much more practical and is only limited by the number of doctors in the country. As a result, we have a unique position above our competitors to provide a more substantial contribution towards achieving our SDG target.
We plan to expand our search feature from doctors to health providing centers such as hospitals, clinics, and vaccination centers. 
We also plan to add an e-channeling feature once we have the required financial standing. 
We plan to expand our customer support to include live chats and phone calls in addition to emails, as well.

Our website will be composed of the following features
------------------------------------------------------
Provides the ability to register and create and customize profiles for both patients and doctors.
Provides a comprehensive search feature which allows searching for doctors by name, specialization and place or city of work. Search results will be sorted based on proximity to the user.
Patients are provided access to a massive database which contains details on places of works, work hours and working days of every doctor registered on the website.
Displays a map showing locations of all places of work for each doctor. The map will also provide the user with directions to get to those locations.
Has responsive customer support via e-mail.
The website will provide users with the option to choose one of the three languages spoken in Sri Lanka, that’s to say Sinhala, English, and Tamil, as the website language.
The website will be written in way that would makes it highly compatible with screen readers. This will help visually impaired people improving accessibility of the website.
